# Cybersecurity401 Project: Text Steganography  

## Project Description  
**Steganography** is the practice of hiding sensitive data within other media to protect it from unauthorized access. In this project, we focus on **image steganography**, specifically using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique. This method embeds secret data in the least significant bits of image pixels, offering a simple yet effective approach for concealing information.  

### Why Image Steganography?  
- Visual appeal and straightforward implementation.  
- Alignment with our minimal experience in cybersecurity.  
- Strong support from Python libraries like **Stegano**, which streamline development and provide GUI options.  

### Key Features  
1. **Data Concealment**: Securely embed sensitive data within images using the LSB technique.  
2. **Encryption**: Incorporate **AES-128 encryption** to enhance data confidentiality.  
3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Add secure login functionality to encrypt and decrypt data.  

### Development Strategy  
- Leverage Python libraries and frameworks to implement the steganography system.  
- Use research papers, source codes, and additional resources for informed decision-making.  
- Explore GUI development to enhance the project's user experience.
